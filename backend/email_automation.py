I hope this email finds you well. I noticed {company_name} and was impressed by your work in the {industry or 'business'} space.

I'm reaching out because I've been helping companies like yours increase their qualified leads by 40-60% using AI-powered lead generation strategies. 

Here's what I've been able to achieve for similar companies:
• 3x increase in qualified leads within 90 days
• 50% reduction in cost per lead
• Automated lead qualification and nurturing
• 24/7 lead generation without manual work

Would you be interested in a quick 15-minute call to discuss how this could work for {company_name}? I can share some specific strategies that have worked well in your industry.

If this isn't the right time, no worries at all. I'd be happy to send you some free resources on lead generation best practices.

Hi {contact_name},

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about lead generation strategies for {company_name}.

I understand you're busy, so I'll keep this brief. I've attached a quick case study showing how we helped a similar company in {industry} increase their qualified leads by 50% in just 60 days.

Would you be open to a brief call this week to discuss?

Hi {contact_name},

Quick question: How much time does your team currently spend on lead generation activities?

Most companies I work with spend 10-15 hours per week on manual lead research, outreach, and follow-up. We've automated this entire process, freeing up your team to focus on closing deals instead of finding them.

For {company_name}, this could mean:
• 40-60% more qualified leads
• 50% less time on lead generation
• Automated follow-up sequences
• Real-time lead scoring

Interested in seeing how this works?
